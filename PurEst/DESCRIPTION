Description: This package allows for the adjustment of DNA methylation beta values
based on sample-purity, to account for the effect of tumour composition in the 
experimentally determined beta values. Additionally, it also allows for the estimation
of sample purity from undajusted beta values using reference data.

    The PurEst package consists of four functions 
    
    -> beta_correction_for_cohorts() to correct betas from cohorts of samples with 
    known betas and sample purities following the Staaf & Aine beta adjustment 
    method (Staaf & Aine, PlosOne, 2022)

    -> reference_regression_generator() to generate reference linar models from
    reference betas and purities to be used as reference for the purity
    estimation of samples with unkonwn purity values and the correction of the
    beta values of those cases.
    
    -> PurEst() to predict sample purity based on the output of the previous 
    function and beta values of the samples with unknown purities.
    
    -> reference_based_beta_correction() to correct beta values based on reference
    data using two possible approaches; using the original reference regressions
    or refitting them adding the betas to correct and the predicted sample purities
    as new data points.
